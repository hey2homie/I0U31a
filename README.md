Small project from the KU Leuven course "Statistical Methods for Bioinformatics" for second part of this
course.

### Description of the dataset

The dataset contains the expression levels of 71 proteins measured in the cerebral cortex of 8 classes of 
control and Down syndrome mice exposed to context fear conditioning, a task used to assess associative 
learning. The eight classes of mice are described based on genotype (control or trisomic), behavioral assay
(stimulated to learn (context-shock) or not (shock-context)) and treatment (saline or drug Memantine). The 
original experiment aimed to test the effect of the drug Memantine in recovering the ability to learn in 
trisomic mice.
